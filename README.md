# Neural-Architecture-Selection
## Papers
To gather some awesome neural architecture seleciton papers (history).
### Very old
[Prediction Risk and Architecture Selection
for Neural Networks](http://smartquant.com/references/NeuralNetworks/neural5.pdf)<br />
```
This paper is kind of stats paper that adopts CV (cross-validation) as well as statistical estimation for selection of MLPs.
